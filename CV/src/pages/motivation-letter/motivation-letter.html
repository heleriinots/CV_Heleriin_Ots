      Dear Net Group representative,
    </p>
    <p>
      I am writing to apply for a position in the Net Group summer university.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am currently a second year student obtaining a bachelor’s degree in Informatics at the Tallinn University of
      Technology. At university I have studied Java and Python in-depth, furthermore, I have learned the basics of C++.
      Moreover, I have some previous experience with the creation of web applications, at university i have programmed
      small projects with JavaScript, jQuery, PHP and Node.js. During my studies I have also come in contact with SQL
      and I have created a some databases in MySQL and MS Access. In addition, I am currently in a team of developers
      who are creating an app for the European Universities Debating Championship 2017, this endeavour has taught me how
      work with larger projects looks like, and which tools and means are used to develop such applications, it is also
      my first experience creating a mobile app.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides my university studies I have also delved into assistant teaching at the Tallinn University of Technology,
      namely I have helped first-year students to grasp the basics of Java and Python during the In-depth Basic Course
      of Programming and the Basic curse of programming in Java, in addition to that, I have also created Java materials
      for the aforementioned course. I have previously worked in the breakfast department of the hotel Olümpia, where I
      had a chance to test my English, French and Russian speaking abilities, it was also an experience that taught me
      how to understand the wishes of people who have different cultural backgrounds and I took with me the skill of
      focusing on small details and the knowledge, how to be precise and concrete in my work. I developed my
      communications skills further whilst working at H&M, customer service has taught me quick and creative thinking,
      which is also of use whilst programming, it helps me to find solutions to problems that arise when I write code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why am I interested in taking part of the Net Group summer university?. The development of new skills usually
      happens whilst working and the summer university offers a marvelous chance to put oneself to the test whilst
      solving realistic tasks, moreover it is a possibility to learn under the guidance of professionals and see, how
      work in an IT company looks like, which tools, programming languages and software are used and how a problem
      solving and client-approved final product is created. Whilst studying at university I feel the lack of a practical
      outlet and I would like to tackle an endeavour, which would force me to use the skills that I have learned thus
      far and which would teach me a lot at the same time, for instance I have no previous experience with .NET and
      SharePoint, the summer university would offer me a chance to learn about these tools. Of course I would like to
      make new connections with people who are interested in IT, with whom it would be nice to converse with and whose
      programming tips would be useful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopefully you will consider my application to the Net Group summer university. I would be obliged if you were to
      offer me this superb chance to develop my skills. I would also be interested in solving the individual task and
      applying for an apprenticeship. I look forward to your reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours faithfully,
    </p>
    <p>
      Heleriin Ots
